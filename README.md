# AdventOfCode
C# projects for [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/).
This repository also includes unit tests for the solutions (if suitable).
Not all problems have been solved and solutions might not be ideal algorithmic wise.

Getting results for a specific puzzle (assuming it was implemented):

1. Paste data into `data.txt`
2. Update Program.cs to use the appropriate day class
3. Run program to get solution
